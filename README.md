## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See Deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and NPM. NPM is included in the newer versions of Node.js.

### Installation

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:80
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```


## Deployment

Deployment to Github Pages is really fast and easy using the [push-dir](https://github.com/L33T-KR3W/push-dir) package. 

In order to deploy we just need to have a generated static page and then run the following command.

``` bash
# deploy static project to github pages
$ npm run deploy

# shorthand to generate and deploy at once
$ npm run generate && npm run deploy

```
